        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
        <p>{{.AppName}} is designed with privacy as the core principle. We believe you should be able to search without being tracked.</p>

        <h2>What We Don't Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not track your searches</li>
            <li>We do not store your IP address</li>
            <li>We do not use tracking cookies</li>
            <li>We do not fingerprint your browser</li>
            <li>We do not share any data with third parties</li>
            <li>We do not build user profiles</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Essential Cookies</h2>
        <p>We only use strictly necessary cookies for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Age verification (required by law)</li>
            <li>User preferences (theme, safe search)</li>
            <li>Session management (admin panel only)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These cookies are never used for tracking and are stored locally on your device.</p>

        <h2>Thumbnail Proxy</h2>
        <p>When you view search results, thumbnails are proxied through our server. This prevents the source sites from tracking your IP address when loading images.</p>

        <h2>Server Logs</h2>
        <p>By default, {{.AppName}} does not log search queries. Server administrators may enable access logs for debugging, but these do not include search terms.</p>

        <h2>Questions?</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about our privacy practices, please <a href="/server/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
